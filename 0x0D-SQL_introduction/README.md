this is the beggining of my sql journey.
In this project I will be focusing mainly on ddl and dml. 
I'll be working with relational databases more because they are easier to use and comprehend compared to the other databases.
Welcome and incase you notice something that i could have done better please don't forget to just let me know, thank you
