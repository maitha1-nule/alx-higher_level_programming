	====Welcome to javaScript Object scopes and Closures.=====

In todays project mainly from the resources provided ive learned about objects you know what this means right..OOP in js, which is more simple compared to all other programming languages.

Objects in real life have have propesrties and they behavior, what i mean by this is that they can do things. NB// they are declared using {}
	example:::
let user = {}; //how they are created, the syntax

let user = {
name: 'Ahmed',
age: 30;
course: 'software Engineering';
};
	whenever we want to access one of the objects here, we can use the dot(.) notation or bracket[] notation. personally i prefer the dot notation hence I'll show you a small example because its easier and easy to use, on the square brackets notation id say, reserch on it.
=== to access foe example the name we can say, 'user.name' easy right ??

We can also add methods inside functions, more on this feel free to check my codes.

	js classes
classes are infact special functions. There are 2 ways of defining classses, ie class expressions and class declarations.
example: always remembr the first letter should be "capital"
	class Rectangle {
	constructor(height,width){
	this.height = height;
	this.width = width;
}
}
	the first example is about class declaration, on class expression the first line changes abit but the rest are al the same ie.
	const Rectangle = class {
	//everything else stays the same
}

I think this is enough for an introduction, if you have futher questions after checking my codes, feel free to contact me, thank you!!!
