In this 0x0E-SQL_more_queries project i learned about the diffrent methods to add users in a database using sql, grant users diffrent access types, how to join tables together using either:
        *full join
        *left joi
        *inner join
        *full outer join
        *right join
        *right join

                        Granting privileges to users
To grant permission to s user we can use the command:
        GRANT:
usage GRANT USER 'username' @ 'localhost'
eg GRANT SELECT ON 'clasicmodel' TO 'bob'@localhost;

                        joins In sql
        *LEFT JOIN
 syntax include: SELECT <table> FROM iabeller A LEFT JOIN iabeller B ON A.key = B.key;

        *INNER JOIN
syntax include:  SELECT <table> FROM iabeller A INNER JOIN iabeller B ON A.key = B.key;

        *RIGHT JOIN
syntax include:  SELECT <table> FROM iabeller A RIGHT JOIN iabeller B ON A.key = B.key;

        *LEFT JOIN
syntax include:  SELECT <table> FROM iabeller A LEFT JOIN iabeller B ON A.key = B.key;

        *FULL OUTER JOIN
syntax include:  SELECT <table> FROM iabeller A FULL JOIN iabeller B ON A.key = B.key;

syntax include:  SELECT <table> FROM iabeller A INNER JOIN iabeller B ON A.key = B.key WHERE A.key is NULL OR B>key is NULL;
        FOR MORE inFORMALTION JUST DM ME,AND DONT FORGET TO LOOK AT MY CODE.
        THANK YOU
